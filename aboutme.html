  <h3 style="color:blue;"> About Me </h3>
  <p style="color:blue;"> In'Spire Epifania Amore Hodgson was born on December 10, 2000 at General Hospital to childhood sweethearts LaDiamond Harvey and Michael Hodgson.
    Her name describes her to the fullest extent. In'Spire, inspires people almost everyday from her intelligence to her humbleness. In'Spire's mother,LaDiamond knew her daughter deserved nothing but the best!
    So, she put In'Spire in the best schools of San Francisco where she thrived amazingly without the help of anyone. She got straight A's from Kindergarten to first grade which got her a full ride to Saint Ignatius College Prepatory.
    She has recently been accepted into Girls Who Code pursuing her dream of becoming a computer software developer.
